# Ravens Progressive Matrices Solver

Most of the logic to solve a RPM problem can be found in Agent.py
Once you clone the repo, run "python3 RavensProject.py"

NOTE: This was an attempt to create an agent that can solve RPM problems but the agent is still limited
and can get some problems incorrect.
